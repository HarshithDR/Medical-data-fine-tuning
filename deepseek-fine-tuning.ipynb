She's had a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test, and the question is asking what cystometry would most likely show regarding her residual volume and detrusor contractions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the information. Involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing suggests a possible issue with the lower urinary tract, specifically the bladder. The fact that she doesn't leak at night points towards a possible daytime issue, maybe something related to bladder capacity or control.\n\nNow, she undergoes a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. The Q-tip test is commonly used to assess urethral function, especially in women. It involves inserting a Q-tip catheter into the urethra and measuring the pressure at the urethral meatus. If the pressure is higher than normal, it might indicate an obstruction or functional problem.\n\nSo, considering the Q-tip test findings, if it shows elevated pressure, that could suggest urethral obstruction. This might lead to difficulty in fully emptying the bladder, which could contribute to the daytime urinary incontinence. The gynecological exam might have identified any structural issues or abnormalities that could be contributing to this obstruction.\n\nNow, looking at what cystometry would reveal. Cystometry, also known as a filling test, assesses how the bladder fills and how it responds to filling. It measures the residual volume, which is the volume of urine left in the bladder after emptying. If the residual volume is high, that might indicate incomplete emptying.\n\nDetrusor contractions are the contractions of the detrusor muscle (the muscle layer of the bladder) that help expel urine. In cystometry, we look at how well the detrusor muscle contracts and empty the bladder. If the detrusor contractions are weak or ineffective, it can lead to retention of urine and difficulty in starting urination.\n\nPutting this together, if the Q-tip test shows elevated pressure, it's possible that there's urethral obstruction. This might mean that the woman has difficulty fully emptying her bladder, leading to a higher residual volume. Additionally, if the detrusor contractions are not strong enough, the bladder might not empty effectively, contributing to the daytime incontinence.\n\nSo, in the cystometry, we'd likely see a higher residual volume due to incomplete emptying, possibly related to urethral obstruction, and maybe some evidence of weak detrusor contractions, which might not be sufficient to completely empty the bladder.\n\nI should also consider other possibilities. Maybe the issue is with the urethral sphincter, making it hard to relax, causing the bladder to not empty completely. Or perhaps there's a neurologic issue affecting bladder control, but since she doesn't leak at night, it's more likely a mechanical problem rather than a neurologic one.\n\nIn summary, the cystometry would show an increased residual volume and possibly abnormal detrusor contractions, indicating that the bladder isn't emptying properly, likely due to urethral obstruction or other mechanical issues.\n</think>\n\nCystometry in this case would most likely reveal an increased residual volume and abnormal detrusor contractions. The elevated Q-tip test suggests urethral obstruction, leading to incomplete bladder emptying. This obstruction contributes to a higher residual volume. Additionally, weak or ineffective detrusor contractions may be observed, indicating that the bladder does not empty adequately. This combination points to a mechanical issue, such as urethral sphincter dysfunction, rather than a neurologic one, given the absence of nighttime leakage.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Fine tuning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Updated training prompt style to add </think> tag \ntrain_prompt_style = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. \nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request. \nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning. \nPlease answer the following medical question. \n\n### Question:\n{}\n\n### Response:\n<think>\n{}\n</think>\n{}\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-19T04:34:19.293169Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-19T04:34:19.293503Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-19T04:34:19.298349Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-19T04:34:19.293481Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-19T04:34:19.297364Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset = load_dataset(\"FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT\", \"en\", split = \"train[0:500]\", trust_remote_code = True)\n\ndataset","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-19T04:36:08.376951Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-19T04:36:08.377382Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-19T04:36:11.488545Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-19T04:36:08.377347Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-19T04:36:11.487886Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"README.md:   0%|          | 0.00/1.25k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"2a932218713147d1b149dee14c377113"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"medical_o1_sft.json:   0%|          | 0.00/74.1M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"d9f4998c5b5749f2a02ce430881ae281"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/25371 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"a7dbbf7e6e1e4d55b4e03eb3e4bd6f77"}},"metadata":{}},{"execution_count":29,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"Dataset({\n    features: ['Question', 'Complex_CoT', 'Response'],\n    num_rows: 500\n})"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":29},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset[1]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-19T04:36:21.977886Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-19T04:36:21.978192Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-19T04:36:21.985703Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-19T04:36:21.978169Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-19T04:36:21.984925Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":30,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'Question': 'A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol use, who has been abstinent for the past 10 years, presents with sudden onset dysarthria, shuffling gait, and intention tremors. Given this clinical presentation and history, what is the most likely diagnosis?',\n 'Complex_CoT': \"Alright, let’s break this down. We have a 45-year-old man here, who suddenly starts showing some pretty specific symptoms: dysarthria, shuffling gait, and those intention tremors. This suggests something's going wrong with motor control, probably involving the cerebellum or its connections.\\n\\nNow, what's intriguing is that he's had a history of alcohol use, but he's been off it for the past 10 years. Alcohol can do a number on the cerebellum, leading to degeneration, and apparently, the effects can hang around or even appear long after one stops drinking.\\n\\nAt first glance, these symptoms look like they could be some kind of chronic degeneration, maybe something like alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, but hold on. This looks different. The symptoms just came on all of a sudden. Chronic degenerations typically have a more gradual onset.\\n\\nOkay, let’s reconsider this sudden nature. It’s making me think of something more acute, more rapid onset. Hmm, if we dig back into his history of drinking, there might have been some damage done, leading to nutritional deficiencies, like a lack of thiamine.\\n\\nWernicke’s encephalopathy is a classic possibility here. That condition pops up due to thiamine deficiency, often after a history of alcohol use. It’s known for causing ataxia, confusion, and eye movement issues. However, he’s not showing the full triad of symptoms; there's no mention of confusion or eye problems, so maybe it doesn’t fit perfectly.\\n\\nOh, wait a second, maybe we're missing something simpler. Given the acute nature of the symptoms, maybe this is more in line with something like a stroke. Sudden onset can definitely suggest a vascular event. With his alcohol history, he’s at risk for things like high blood pressure, which can increase stroke risk.\\n\\nIn particular, lacunar strokes can mess with motor coordination, speech, the works. These are small, but significant enough to cause these exact symptoms: dysarthria, tremors, and a shuffling gait.\\n\\nBut hang on, what if there’s another angle we’re missing? Chronic alcohol effects might still play a role here, just in a different way. There’s a condition called acquired hepatocerebral degeneration. This can happen in people with a history of liver disease due to alcohol, even years after they’ve quit. It can result in symptoms like these because of how substances get deposited in the brain.\\n\\nLinking this back to our patient, his history with alcohol could’ve led to some liver issues, and now, here we are with these symptoms showing up suddenly. Makes sense, right? So, considering everything, acquired hepatocerebral degeneration seems to fit quite nicely. That’s probably our most fitting diagnosis for this situation.\",\n 'Response': \"Considering the clinical presentation of sudden onset dysarthria, shuffling gait, and intention tremors in a 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol use who has been abstinent for the past 10 years, the most likely diagnosis is acquired hepatocerebral degeneration.\\n\\nThis condition is associated with chronic liver disease, which can often be a consequence of long-term alcohol use.

Based on these findings, what would cystometry most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions?\\n\\n### Response:\\n<think>\\nOkay, let's think about this step by step. There's a 61-year-old woman here who's been dealing with involuntary urine leakages whenever she's doing something that ups her abdominal pressure like coughing or sneezing. This sounds a lot like stress urinary incontinence to me. Now, it's interesting that she doesn't have any issues at night; she isn't experiencing leakage while sleeping. This likely means her bladder's ability to hold urine is fine when she isn't under physical stress. Hmm, that's a clue that we're dealing with something related to pressure rather than a bladder muscle problem. \\n\\nThe fact that she underwent a Q-tip test is intriguing too. This test is usually done to assess urethral mobility. In stress incontinence, a Q-tip might move significantly, showing urethral hypermobility. This kind of movement often means there's a weakness in the support structures that should help keep the urethra closed during increases in abdominal pressure. So, that's aligning well with stress incontinence.\\n\\nNow, let's think about what would happen during cystometry. Since stress incontinence isn't usually about sudden bladder contractions, I wouldn't expect to see involuntary detrusor contractions during this test. Her bladder isn't spasming or anything; it's more about the support structure failing under stress. Plus, she likely empties her bladder completely because stress incontinence doesn't typically involve incomplete emptying. So, her residual volume should be pretty normal. \\n\\nAll in all, it seems like if they do a cystometry on her, it will likely show a normal residual volume and no involuntary contractions. Yup, I think that makes sense given her symptoms and the typical presentations of stress urinary incontinence.\\n</think>\\nCystometry in this case of stress urinary incontinence would most likely reveal a normal post-void residual volume, as stress incontinence typically does not involve issues with bladder emptying. Additionally, since stress urinary incontinence is primarily related to physical exertion and not an overactive bladder, you would not expect to see any involuntary detrusor contractions during the test.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":37},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## LoRA","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"FastLanguageModel.for_training(model)\nmodel_lora = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    model, \n    r = 16,\n    target_modules = [\n        \"q_proj\",\n        \"k_proj\",\n        \"v_proj\",\n        \"o_proj\",\n        \"gate_proj\",\n        \"up_proj\",\n        \"down_proj\",\n    ],\n    lora_alpha = 16,\n    lora_dropout = 0,\n    bias = \"none\",\n    use_gradient_checkpointing = \"unsloth\",\n    random_state = 1111,\n    use_rslora = False,\n    loftq_config = None,\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-19T05:02:35.802470Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-19T05:02:35.802748Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-19T05:02:41.838202Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-19T05:02:35.802727Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-19T05:02:41.837395Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":48},{"cell_type":"code","source":"trainer = SFTTrainer(\n    model=model_lora, \n    tokenizer=tokenizer, \n    train_dataset=dataset_finetune, \n    dataset_text_field=\"text\", \n    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,\n    dataset_num_proc=2, \n    \n    args=TrainingArguments(\n        per_device_train_batch_size=2,  \n        gradient_accumulation_steps=4,\n        num_train_epochs=1, \n        warmup_steps=5,  \n        max_steps=60,  \n        learning_rate=2e-4,\n        fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(),  \n        bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(),\n        logging_steps=10,  \n        optim=\"adamw_8bit\", \n        weight_decay=0.01,  \n        lr_scheduler_type=\"linear\",\n        seed=3407, \n        output_dir=\"outputs\", \n    ),\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-19T05:02:45.102037Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-19T05:02:45.102349Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-19T05:02:51.341215Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-19T05:02:45.102326Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-19T05:02:51.340355Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Converting train dataset to ChatML (num_proc=2):   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"d182057577dc48b8a9b3abff2440c920"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Applying chat template to train dataset (num_proc=2):   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"0ac669e942c44dd0aa76e700ec64278c"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Tokenizing train dataset (num_proc=2):   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"72f5495d092542669c34b55b3668be67"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Tokenizing train dataset (num_proc=2):   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"6edace91c74841b7a38528642a191a12"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"No label_names provided for model class `PeftModelForCausalLM`.

We have a 61-year-old woman who's been dealing with involuntary urine loss during things like coughing or sneezing, but she's not leaking at night. That suggests she might have some kind of problem with her pelvic floor muscles or maybe her bladder.\n\nNow, she's got a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. Let's break that down. The Q-tip test is usually used to check for urethral obstruction. If it's positive, that means there's something blocking the urethra, like a urethral stricture or something else.\n\nGiven that she's had a positive Q-tip test, it's likely there's a blockage in her urethra. If there's a urethral stricture, that could lead to problems with urination, like difficulty starting to urinate or having a weak stream. But in her case, it's more about the involuntary loss when she coughs or sneezes.\n\nSo, considering her symptoms and the Q-tip test, we can imagine that she might have a urethral obstruction. This could be due to a stricture, but also potentially due to something like a urethral valve or some kind of functional obstruction.\n\nNow, let's think about what this means for her bladder. With a urethral obstruction, the bladder is often overfilled, causing it to leak involuntarily. This is because the body tries to compensate by increasing bladder pressure to push out urine, but if there's an obstruction, it can't effectively do that.\n\nIn this situation, when we look at cystometry, it's going to show what's happening in her bladder. The residual volume is the amount of urine left in her bladder after she's emptied it. If she's experiencing urinary leakage, we'd expect her residual volume to be higher than normal, because the bladder isn't effectively emptying all the way.\n\nAs for detrusor contractions, these are the contractions of the bladder muscle that help push urine out. If there's a urethral obstruction, the contractions might not be as strong or as effective because the bladder is trying to compensate by increasing pressure. So, we might see some weak or ineffective contractions during cystometry.\n\nIn summary, given her symptoms and the positive Q-tip test, we're expecting to see a higher residual volume and potentially weaker or ineffective detrusor contractions during cystometry. That makes sense with what we know about urethral obstructions and their effects on bladder function.\n</think>\nBased on the findings of the Q-tip test and the symptoms described, cystometry would most likely reveal an increased residual volume and weak or ineffective detrusor contractions. The positive Q-tip test suggests a urethral obstruction, which can lead to bladder overfilling and weak contractions as the bladder attempts to compensate for the obstruction. This aligns with the symptoms of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing. Therefore, the cystometric findings would reflect these bladder dynamics.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":52},{"cell_type":"code","source":"new_model_local = \"DeepSeek-R1-Medical-COT\"\nmodel_lora.save_pretrained(new_model_local) \ntokenizer.save_pretrained(new_model_local)\n\nmodel_lora.save_pretrained_merged(new_model_local, tokenizer, save_method = \"merged_16bit\",)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-19T05:25:18.753511Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-19T05:25:18.753767Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-19T05:27:11.228205Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-19T05:25:18.753744Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-19T05:27:11.227483Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Unsloth: You have 2 CPUs.
